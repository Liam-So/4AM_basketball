      "Coby played for Riverview High School in Cape Breton. The $4000 scholarship will help fund his summer of basketball on the BNS U17 Team. We could not be more proud to have Coby as the first ever recipient of the scholarship- he's a phenomenal basketball player, but more importantly, his character embodies Andrew's. Coby travelled from Cape Breton to attend the 2nd Annual 4AM Camp.",
